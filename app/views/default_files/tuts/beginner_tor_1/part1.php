	<h1>Part 1: Set up an account with DigitalOcean and claim your free credits</h1>
	<p>This part is really quite simple. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c2cd2b85cb87" target="_blank">Click here</a> to create your account. <span class="tiny">(Yes thats a referral link... I'd love to get some more credits and don't feel bad about using it)</span></p>
	<p>Once you have registered and get to the billing stage you should see the option to enter a credit card, use paypal or enter a promo code. </p>
	<p>At the time of this writing the following codes (in bold) are all supposed to be working: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong><span class="promo">VPS10</span></strong> - $10 free credit.</li>
	  <li><strong><span class="promo">thechangelog10</span></strong> - $10 free credit or &quot;save $30 existing customers&quot;</li>
	  <li><strong><span class="promo">2mo512</span></strong> - this is the one I used, $10 free credit.</li>
	  <li>Ill add more if I hear they are verified working. I can't test them myself when they are for new customers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>From what I experienced, you don't have to pay anything to try it out if you have a valid promo code. I'd suggest prepaying $10.00 - $25.00 via paypal though. The $10 credit will get you ~2 months free if you only use one of the smallest VMs. Theres a lot more you can do with these (as we'll get into later) so you'll probably want the extra budget in there if you plan to experiment a lot.</p>
	<p>Once you've verified your account and set up some sort of billing or free credit you should find yourself looking at a page like this:</p>
	<p class="image"><?= img('assets/tut_images/'.$tut.'/main_page.JPG') ?></p>
	<p>If you don't plan to use SSH keys for accessing your server you can skip ahead to the &quot;Create your first droplet&quot; section. I'd suggest setting up your SSH keys now though to make life easier down the road.</p>
